This definition of telework includes what is generally referred to as remote work but does not include any part of work done while on official travel or mobile work.</p>\n<p>You may also be familiar with the terms “telecommuting” and “flexible workplace” and both are sometimes used to describe what we now generally refer to as “telework.” While “remote” and “mobile” work are also terms that are sometimes used as synonyms for telework, they tend to operate differently than telework as is apparent in the detailed operational definition.</p>\n<p>For consistency, OPM recommends that all agencies use the term “telework” for reporting purposes and for all other activities related to policy and legislation, as defined in the Act.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/posts/what-is-telework-literally/","prefix":"2020-06-08"},"frontmatter":{"title":"What is telework literally","author":"opm.gov","category":"best practices","description":"What is telework literally","cover":null}},"authornote":{"id":"ef9a2e33-a339-5306-aa60-255e1813c3b7","html":"<p><strong>Telework</strong> 社区内的转载内容遵循原文章授权及衍生协议；原创及作者授权内容如无特殊说明，均遵循<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/\">知识共享许可协议(CC)</a>的<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/\">CC BY-ND 4.0</a>版本协议，这意味着您可以在保持内容不变的情况下，自由转载和分发，并需要注明来源。如有版权事宜请<a href=\"mailto://cc@telework.club\">联系</a></p>"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"facebook":{"appId":""}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/posts/what-is-telework-literally/","prev":{"id":"61f0fb1b-0b36-50ac-aa92-cf02eafe6433","fields":{"slug":"/posts/网络安全标准实践指南/","prefix":"2020-06-08","source":"posts"},"frontmatter":{"title":"网络安全标准实践指南","category":"best practices"}},"source":"posts"}}}
